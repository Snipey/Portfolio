# Welcome!

You have stumbled onto my humble site where I will post my thought on programming languages, or guides on some cool frameworks I find on my adventures. The point is to have fun and explore the wonderful world of open source.

## Goals

- Write awesome tutorials
- Expand my knowledge and experiment with new Tech
- Comment on the state of programming or the state of a certain language

## Conclusion

You may be asking how can you join in on the action. The first place you should look is on the left of the page where my socials are posted right below my picture.
