Hello there again, We are now into the new year and I feel that it is time to do something fun and exciting to break the day to day bland projects. I have been wanting to learn rust for about 6 months now and did a bunch of research to start this project.

### Experience
I only have experience with a few languages but a firm understanding on software development so I feel comfortable with taking on this task

### Goals
What I want to get out of this experience is making a new open source media server for people to watch their media on and not have to pay a premium for services like [Plex](https://plex.tv) and [Emby](https://emby.media). [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) is a nice solution, but the user interface and TV apps have been neglected for a long time and the project has been divided since the split from [Emby](https://emby.media).

A summary of features I would hope to add are as follows:
- Ease of use
- Watch With Friends
- Load Balancing
- Music Videos

### How can You help?

If you would like to help you can head over to the [Github Repository](https://github.com/OdinMedia/) and see what needs to be done.

## Conclusion
While 2019 may have been a very rocky year 2020 is the start of a new decade and it's time for us to start working together on improving the way software works and interacts with the world around us.
